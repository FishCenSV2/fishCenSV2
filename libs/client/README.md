**NOTE: Currently this class is not being used at all. The `.hpp` and `.cpp` files should have straightforward enough documentation that I do not feel the need to explain anything here. If you just wanted to know more about client server stuff with Boost ASIO then check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).**
